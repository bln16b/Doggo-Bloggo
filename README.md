Motivation

Briefly describe why you want to develop this project.

Brief overview of what you are proposing
Doggo Bloggo is a blogging platform targeted at dog owners.  It’s a place for them to share pictures and information about their furry companions.  

Features to be implemented (Functional requirements)
User creation
User authentication
Storage for blog images and posts
A section for users to comment on each others’ posts
Responsive UX

Risk / Challenges

One challenge will be dealing with larger amounts of data and page scrolling times.  For instance, if we were to implement an “infinite” scrolling feature, we would have to decide how to load the content to avoid loading or scrolling delays.
